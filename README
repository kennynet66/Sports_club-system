I created this project (Maringo Sports club system) as an admin web application using django from python.
This project is aimed in managing data of a sports club that is;
  - Managing member details
  - Managing items in the store such as games equipments
  - Show varous sports and their patrons
  - Create a purchasing system that enables users to buy store items and update the inventory

So far;
  - I have created the database model
  - I have created a Frontend where information from the database is displayed
  - I have created an Authentication system for authenticating Admins


  Why this project?
    This project helped me put into practice the skills I needed to work ad a back-end engineer and also gives a taste of the front-end.
